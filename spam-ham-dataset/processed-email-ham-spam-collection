ham	Diane, please forward this to Kendell, thanks!     Brandy Corbett  Contracts Manager  Willbrook Solutions, Inc.  256-864-8731 x107     From: Brandy Corbett [mailto:bcorbett@willbrook.com]  Sent: Monday, November 24, 2014 11:12 AM To: kendell.phillips@willbrook.com; kphillip1@gmail.com Subject: stock email     Did you get this??     My oh my, how time flies!  I'm sure you recall, recipients of this email were issued a stock option for stock in Willbrook Solutions Inc. in December 2009 from the ISOP plan that existed at that time.  In the near future, you will be vested 100% in that stock option.  Once vested, you have five years to purchase the stock at the strike price of $3.42.  Once you purchase the stock, you will share in the profits and losses of Willbrook Solutions.  As an owner of stock, you will be issued a K-1 every year for taxes that you will be responsible for paying.  At the discretion of the Willbrook Solutions CEO, money can be distributed from the company and will be divide between all owners at any time.  The amount you receive will depend on the % ownership you have of outstanding shares of Willbrook Solutions stock.  Remember, once you own the stock, it can not be sold or transferred. If you voluntarily terminate your employment with Willbrook Solutions, the company has the option to repurchase your stock, but that repurchase is not guaranteed.  The repurchase price may be more or less than what you paid for the stock, depending on current valuation and future business projections.     An appraisal of the value of the Company is done annually for the ESOP. Last year the appraisal placed the value of company stock at $3.38 per share.  Since that time, stock has been repurchased and the estimated 2013 value of the company divided by outstanding shares is $3.68/share. Should you choose to purchase stock at any time, we process the transaction on the first day of any quarter during the year.  Your request to purchase should be made to Ms. Kim Leach at least 2 weeks prior to the start of the next quarter.   For example, Jan 1, 2015 would be the earliest date you can purchase stock using your newly vested stock option. If you plan to purchase for that transaction date, please notify Kim no later than December 15, 2014.  If you have any questions please let me know.     V/R Bonita Phillips

Though a  personal milestone for me, in AAII terms, itâ€™s not very long. I continue to  rank in the bottom third in terms of seniority. My predecessor, Maria  Crawford Scott, worked at AAII for 26 years before retiring. Itâ€™s a  testament to the organization that so many of our talented staff stay.  Everyone shows up with a sense of pride, a commitment to hard work and a  friendly attitude. Itâ€™s evident throughout the office and we hope it shines  through in our interaction with youâ€”be it via print, online, over the phone  or in person.  Itâ€™s not often that one gets a chance to step into a truly good position,  but I am lucky to have had such an opportunity. Not only do I get to work  with great people, but I also get to interact with many individual investors  and many people throughout the industry. Merely being with AAII has opened  doors in terms of reaching out to various professionals and academics. I can  tell you that nothing in the job description said â€œsit down with some of the  brightest minds in finance and have a conversation about investing with  them,â€ but this has become a part of my responsibilities that I thoroughly  enjoy and, based on feedback, members appreciate when we pass on their  insightful thoughts.  As with any job, responsibility comes with the paycheck. In my particular  case, itâ€™s not just about aiming high, but also about constantly considering  what content should and should not be included. Publishing a 40-page  investing journal isnâ€™t simply about making deadlines, itâ€™s about providing  content that helps you make better decisions. Iâ€™m careful about what goes  in, and there are have been many articles and article proposals that Iâ€™ve  declined. Itâ€™s part of being an editor.  In writing this monthâ€™s note, I took a look at my first Editor  <url â€™s Note from January  2010. In it, I wrote, â€œA big part of my role at AAII is to continue evolving  this magazine and all of the content that we produce. As a result, you will  see changes.â€ Five years later, Iâ€™m happy to say, â€œProgress has been made.â€  Two new periodic columns have been added, Beginning Investor and Retired  Investor. The latter was in response to requests by members. In addition, a  new article category has been created, Behavioral Finance. The latest  article on this subject is an interview with University of  Californiaâ€”Berkeley professor Terry Odean, which youâ€™ll find here  <url . (As a quick aside,  Terry was awarded a dissertation grant from AAII in 1997 for his work in  behavioral finance.)  Behavioral science has become a big area of interest for me since joining  AAII. The more I learn about the intersection of our minds and our finances,  the more Iâ€™m convinced that much of our portfolio performance is dependent  on our emotional tendencies and our ability to set up strategies to cope  with them. So, you will see more about this subject in future issues.  I also intend to discuss aging more in the future. Biology plays a big role  in our finances, and we all need to be prepared to deal with aging. Medical  advances are extending life-spans, which enable more and more of us to  become centenarians. This has financial implications, since weâ€™ll need our  retirement savings to last longer. At the same time, cognitive impairment  affects our ability to make prudent decisions.  In covering these issues, I wonâ€™t shift away from what makes the AAII  Journal, well, the AAII Journal. Youâ€™ll continue to see articles about stock  selection, stock screens, portfolio strategies, funds, bonds and other  investing topics. The mix of articles will just be a little more diverse.  Many articles published over the last five years have started out as  suggestions from members. Though I canâ€™t fulfill every request, feel free to  keep offering ideas. I want you to continue finding the Journal useful in  the years ahead.

I want to take a moment and thank oursponsors.  However, rather than thanking them as sponsors, I want to thankthem as PARTNERS.  With a focus on Total Player Development, coaching andfacilities are all very expensive and are hard to improve without properfunding.  With that in mind, membership economics is also very important.HFCâ€™s Partners help keep membership economical while providing for the bestcoaching and player experience possible.  That said, our goal of TotalPlayer Development is far from over.  The club is in the beginning stages ofour new chapter of growth and we are all figuring out how to best utilizesponsorships and marketing to provide a mutual benefit of the sponsor andHFC.  Improved coaching quality, better equipment, and hopefully our ownfacilities are within reach.If you or your business would like to sponsor events, provide fund raisingopportunities, or join the HFC Partners and Sponsors in forwarding thesuccess of the club, please contact David Mathis at dpmathisjr@gmail.com.In addition, we are in the process of forming an advertising/marketingcommittee to promote tryouts next spring.  We want to increase visibility ofour club throughout the neighborhoods of Huntsville, Madison, andsurrounding areas and we need your ideas!

ham	  NCCIC / US-CERT  <url  National Cyber Awareness System:  TA14-212A: Backoff Point-of-Sale Malware  <url 07/31/2014 07:30 AM EDT  Original release date: July 31, 2014 | Last revised: August 22, 2014   Systems Affected   Point-of-Sale Systems     Overview   This advisory was prepared in collaboration with the National Cybersecurity  and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), United States Secret Service  (USSS), Financial Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC),  and Trustwave Spiderlabs, a trusted partner under contract with the USSS.  The purpose of this release is to provide relevant and actionable technical  indicators for network defense against the PoS malware dubbed "Backoff"  which has been discovered exploiting businesses' administrator accounts  remotely and exfiltrating consumer payment data.  Over the past year, the Secret Service has responded to network intrusions  at numerous businesses throughout the United States that have been impacted  by the â€œBackoffâ€ malware. Seven PoS system providers/vendors have confirmed  that they have had multiple clients affected. Reporting continues on  additional compromised locations, involving private sector entities of all  sizes, and the Secret Service currently estimates that over 1,000 U.S.  businesses are affected.  Recent investigations revealed that malicious actors are using publicly  available tools to locate businesses that use remote desktop applications.  Remote desktop solutions like Microsoft's Remote Desktop  <url  [1], Apple Remote Desktop  <url [2],  Chrome Remote Desktop  <url [3], Splashtop 2  <url  [4], Pulseway  <url  [5] and LogMeIn  <url [6] offer the convenience and  efficiency of connecting to a computer from a remote location. Once these  applications are located, the suspects attempted to brute force the login  feature of the remote desktop solution. After gaining access to what was  often administrator or privileged access accounts, the suspects were then  able to deploy the point-of-sale (PoS) malware and subsequently exfiltrate  consumer payment data via an encrypted POST request.  Organizations that believe they have been impacted should contact their  local Secret Service field office and may contact the NCCIC for additional  information.   Description   â€œBackoffâ€ is a family of PoS malware and has been discovered recently. The  malware family has been witnessed on at least three separate forensic  investigations. Researchers have identified three primary variants to the  â€œBackoffâ€ malware including 1.4, 1.55 (â€œbackoffâ€, â€œgooâ€, â€œMAYâ€, â€œnetâ€), and  1.56 (â€œLASTâ€).  These variations have been seen as far back as October 2013 and continue to  operate as of July 2014. In total, the malware typically consists of the  following four capabilities. An exception is the earliest witnessed variant  (1.4) which does not include keylogging functionality. Additionally, 1.55  â€˜netâ€™ removed the explorer.exe injection component:  *	Scraping memory for track data *	Logging keystrokes *	Command & control (C2) communication *	Injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe  The malicious stub that is injected into explorer.exe is responsible for  persistence in the event the malicious executable crashes or is forcefully  stopped. The malware is responsible for scraping memory from running  processes on the victim machine and searching for track data. Keylogging  functionality is also present in most recent variants of â€œBackoffâ€.  Additionally, the malware has a C2 component that is responsible for  uploading discovered data, updating the malware, downloading/executing  further malware, and uninstalling the malware.  Variants  Based on compiled timestamps and versioning information witnessed in the C2  HTTP POST requests, â€œBackoffâ€ variants were analyzed over a seven month  period. The five variants witnessed in the â€œBackoffâ€ malware family have  notable modifications, to include:  1.55 â€œbackoffâ€  *	Added Local.dat temporary storage for discovered track data *	Added keylogging functionality *	Added â€œgrâ€ POST parameter to include variant name *	Added ability to exfiltrate keylog data *	Supports multiple exfiltration domains *	Changed install path *	Changed User-Agent  1.55 â€œgooâ€  *	Attempts to remove prior version of malware *	Uses 8.8.8.8 as resolver  1.55 â€œMAYâ€  *	No significant updates other than changes to the URI and version name  1.55 â€œnetâ€  *	Removed the explorer.exe injection component  1.56 â€œLASTâ€  *	Re-added the explorer.exe injection component *	Support for multiple domain/URI/port configurations *	Modified code responsible for creating exfiltration thread(s) *	Added persistence techniques  Command & Control Communication  All C2 communication for â€œBackoffâ€ takes place via HTTP POST requests. A  number of POST parameters are included when this malware makes a request to  the C&C server.  *	op : Static value of â€˜1â€™ *	id : randomly generated 7 character string *	ui : Victim username/hostname *	wv : Version of Microsoft Windows *	gr (Not seen in version 1.4) : Malware-specific identifier *	bv : Malware version *	data (optional) : Base64-encoded/RC4-encrypted data  The â€˜idâ€™ parameter is stored in the following location, to ensure it is  consistent across requests:  *	HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\identifier  If this key doesnâ€™t exist, the string will be generated and stored. Data is  encrypted using RC4 prior to being encoded with Base64. The password for RC4  is generated from the â€˜idâ€™ parameter, a static string of â€˜jhgtsd7fjmytkrâ€™,  and the â€˜uiâ€™ parameter. These values are concatenated together and then  hashed using the MD5 algorithm to form the RC4 password. In the above  example, the RC4 password would be â€˜56E15A1B3CB7116CAB0268AC8A2CD943 (The  MD5 hash of â€˜vxeyHkSjhgtsd7fjmytkrJosh @ PC123456).

These breaches can impact a businessâ€™ brand and reputation, while  consumersâ€™ information can be used to make fraudulent purchases or risk  compromise of bank accounts. It is critical to safeguard your corporate  networks and web servers to prevent any unnecessary exposure to compromise  or to mitigate any damage that could be occurring now.   Solution   At the time this advisory is released, the variants of the â€œBackoffâ€™ malware  family are largely undetected by anti-virus (AV) vendors. However, shortly  following the publication of this technical analysis, AV companies will  quickly begin detecting the existing variants. Itâ€™s important to maintain  upâ€toâ€date AV signatures and engines as new threats such as this are  continually being added to your AV solution. Pending AV detection of the  malware variants, network defenders can apply indicators of compromise (IOC)  to a variety of prevention and detection strategies.[7  <url ],[8  <url   ],[9  <url   ] IOCs can be found above.  The forensic investigations of compromises of retail IT/payment networks  indicate that the network compromises allowed the introduction of memory  scraping malware to the payment terminals. Information security  professionals recommend a defense in depth approach to mitigating risk to  retail payment systems. While some of the risk mitigation recommendations  are general in nature, the following strategies provide an approach to  minimize the possibility of an attack and mitigate the risk of data  compromise:  Remote Desktop Access  *	Configure the account lockout settings to lock a user account after a  period of time or a specified number of failed login attempts. This prevents  unlimited unauthorized attempts to login whether from an unauthorized user  or via automated attack types like brute force.[10  <url ] *	Limit the number of users and workstation who can log in using Remote  Desktop. *	Use firewalls (both software and hardware where available) to restrict  access to remote desktop listening ports (default is TCP 3389).[11  <url ] *	Change the default Remote Desktop listening port. *	Define complex password parameters. Configuring an expiration time and  password length and complexity can decrease the amount of time in which a  successful attack can occur.[12  <url ] *	Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for remote desktop access.[13  <url ] *	Install a Remote Desktop Gateway to restrict access.[14  <url ] *	Add an extra layer of authentication and encryption by tunneling your  Remote Desktop through IPSec, SSH or SSL.[15  <url ],[16  <url ] *	Require 2FA when accessing payment processing networks. Even if a virtual  private network is used, it is important that 2FA is implemented to help  mitigate keylogger or credential dumping attacks. *	Limit administrative privileges for users and applications. *	Periodically review systems (local and domain controllers) for unknown and  dormant users.  Network Security  *	Review firewall configurations and ensure that only allowed ports,  services and Internet protocol (IP) addresses are communicating with your  network. This is especially critical for outbound (e.g., egress) firewall  rules in which compromised entities allow ports to communicate to any IP  address on the Internet. Hackers leverage this configuration to exfiltrate  data to their IP addresses. *	Segregate payment processing networks from other networks. *	Apply access control lists (ACLs) on the router configuration to limit  unauthorized traffic to payment processing networks. *	Create strict ACLs segmenting public-facing systems and back-end database  systems that house payment card data. *	Implement data leakage prevention/detection tools to detect and help  prevent data exfiltration. *	Implement tools to detect anomalous network traffic and anomalous behavior  by legitimate users (compromised credentials).  Cash Register and PoS Security  *	Implement hardware-based point-to-point encryption. It is recommended that  EMV-enabled PIN entry devices or other credit-only accepting devices have  Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED) capabilities. SRED-approved  devices can be found at the Payment Card Industry Security Standards  website. *	Install Payment Application Data Security Standard-compliant payment  applications. *	Deploy the latest version of an operating system and ensure it is up to  date with security patches, anti-virus software, file integrity monitoring  and a host-based intrusion-detection system. *	Assign a strong password to security solutions to prevent application  modification. Use two-factor authentication (2FA) where feasible. *	Perform a binary or checksum comparison to ensure unauthorized files are  not installed. *	Ensure any automatic updates from third parties are validated. This means  performing a checksum comparison on the updates prior to deploying them on  PoS systems. It is recommended that merchants work with their PoS vendors to  obtain signatures and hash values to perform this checksum validation. *	Disable unnecessary ports and services, null sessions, default users and  guests. *	Enable logging of events and make sure there is a process to monitor logs  on a daily basis. *	Implement least privileges and ACLs on users and applications on the  system.

ham	Hi all,   If you are not involved with any systems that use  barracuda1.uah.edu/barracuda2.uah.edu/email.uah.edu for outbound email  relay, you can ignore this message.   We have setup a service named smtp.uah.edu to provide non-authenticated,  non-tls/ssl, "soft" smtp relay.  This is to take the place of the barracuda  email appliances as well as any of you still using the old email server,  email.uah.edu, as outbound relay.   This is not intended for use in desktop clients, sending via gmail is the  preferred solution for that use case.   This service is for servers, scanners, printers, etc., that cannot make use  of Google's smtp servers.  Often due to the limitations of the client in  their support of authenticated, tls/ssl, smtp relay that Google requires.   Both smtp.uah.edu and the barracuda[1-2].uah.edu are available at this time.  At some future date the barracuda's will be retired.  We may change the  barracuda DNS entries to point to the smtp.uah.edu host as well, but that is  not planned as yet.   Please use smtp.uah.edu port 25, no auth, going forward instead of the  barracuda[1-2] or email.uah.edu servers.  And please change existing systems  when convenient.   If you have trouble connecting, please contact me and also send me the  client ip of the server so I can ensure it is allowed to connect.  The ip's  currently allowed in the barracuda's should alredy be allowed in the smtp  service, but I could have missed one or had a type-o.   This is not urgent at this time, I mainly want to use the new service going  forward starting now.  New xerox printer setups and such.  It may become  more urgent at a later date.   The new service is rate controlled BTW.   Thanks, William   --  William Eubank Sr Software Development Lead VBRH, C-2A Office of Information Technology (OIT) University of Alabama in Huntsville 256-824-5375 william.eubank@uah.edu       --  You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups  "systemadmin" group.

ham	Placed portable versions of GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, and Blender on the K  drive. Tested launching each from the "somebody" account and everything  works. Placed shortcuts in the net apps start menu folder. Inkscape still  needs some tweaks so it doesn't try to save user settings to the K drive.  Also, got AD authentication to work in Linux. Not as easy as we thought.   
ham	Parents,     Today we discussed how to write a paragraph, topic sentence and supporting sentences.  We wrote down the notes in the 3 subject notebooks.       We read part of Lesson 4 in American History and took notes in the history section of our notebook.  Students need to keep up with these notes.      Today we had Music, so that took a good chunk of our time.  We will make up for it tomorrow.             Tomorrow we will finish Lesson 4 and work on a study guide for our history test.  I am not really comfortable giving them a test on Friday so it will probably be moved to Monday.     Have a great day,     Tesa :-)

ham	 I know OIT is working on AD as part of the identity management project. Where does DDNS fit in?  Is a dynamic DNS service that will serve the whole campus in the picture?  We've got DDNS as part of our AD, but it is becoming more frequent that serious inconveniences arise when our AD and not-AD systems (mac, linux, the occasional standalone windows) need to communicate.  We haven't redirected all our systems' DNS lookups to our AD/DDNS servers, which would be an obvious solution, but if campus DDNS is on the horizon we can just tough it out.  -Jason ---------------------------------------- Jason Winningham Computer Systems Engineer Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of Alabama in Huntsville  --  You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "systemadmin" group.

Nagios - at the moment monitoring 109 hosts and 564 services on my primary  nagios instance.  Can't function without it.  I have a second small monitor  on my desk dedicated to showing the nagios problems summary, and it's the  first thing I look at every time I sit down.  It's also the first thing I  look at when I'm getting a problem reported.  Nagios worked well enough that I never looked at anything else, although  other packages may work as well or better, be easier to configure, etc.  I use nagios to:  - make sure servers/networks are up (duh)  - monitor disk space, CPU utilization, etc  - monitor temperature (and lately humidity) in the server room and some  labs - EB216 hit 76.4 degrees while I was typing. (ask me about my $125 PoE  powered temperature, humidity, and light sensor Arduino stack from Sparkfun,  another $20 to add airflow sensing.  enterprise datacenter monitoring on a  university budget)  - monitor the UPS farm that's running the server farm (2 units currently  showing a warning state of "Status=Online, Replace Battery")  - use a separate nagios instance to monitor lab computers.  the nagios  configuration also includes "Action URLs" for every computer and lab that  allows us to send wake-on-LAN packets to individual machines or to the  entire lab with one click - know what systems are up, and wake them if  they're not, when you are ready to do maintenance. don't waste time walking  around the lab poking power buttons. (administer remotely and don't waste  time walking around period, but that's a different discussion.)  - Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? I have a separate machine that watches the  primary nagios server to make sure I'm not blind.  - monitor printers - know that they're low on toner or out of paper ('cause  users usually won't bother to report it unless it's a crisis for them).  optionally send the report directly to your student assistant for action (if  you have that luxury, I don't)    Nagios configuration tips:  go slowly, look at check intervals and dependencies. build the "parent"  dependencies from nagios outward. If you're not careful, nagios will make so  much noise that all you really know is "there's a problem".  e.g. make sure  that the host ping check will report the host down _before_ the HTTP check  reports that the web service is down, and make sure you know the apache  server is running before you send reports of 20 virtual hosts being down.  Make sure you can see the LAN before you report that you can't get to  google. etc.  make sure the reports get to you - test your configuration, end-to-end.  think about reporting windows - I don't care about printers except 8-5 M-F.  maybe some servers I care about 6am-6pm x365.  I care about server room  temperature 24x7 (experience has taught me I have about 15 minutes before  it's 90 degrees in there, and in 30 minutes I'm losing hardware to the  heat).  -Jason ---------------------------------------- Jason Winningham Computer Systems Engineer Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of Alabama in Huntsville  -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups  "systemadmin" group.

There are currently 3 speeches scheduled and many other exciting events.  Please see the highlights below, or the attached flyer, and attend any of the events that interest you.  Also, please note the security tips listed at the bottom.  For more information, please see the 2014 UAH Cyber Awareness website at: url  *Highlighted Events:* *October 1st: 6:00pm - 8:30pm - UAH Exhibit Hall:* The first event is Cyber Night that will be tomorrow, October 1st from 6:00pm to 8:30 pm in the UAH Exhibit Hall.  The event will consist of 5 short speeches given by security experts.  The keynote speech will be given by Robin "Montana" Williams, who is the Chief of National Cybersecurity Education & Awareness Branch, Department of Homeland Security in Washington, DC.  For more information or registration, please visit: url  *October 15th: 2:00pm - 3:00pm - Charger Union Theater:* Security professional Jeremy Conway will present on "Information Left Behind".  This presentation will highlight the ways that each of us unintentionally leave information behind.  Mr. Conway has a vast security history and is a great presenter.  *October 28th: 5:30pm - 6:30pm - Charger Union Theater:* Ethical hacker and security expert Brad Horton will present on the "Internet Gone Wrong".  In this presentation, Mr. Horton will discuss current events in social media, along with other online services.  *October 27th - 31st: Lunch time - Charger Union:* Office of Information Technology will be presenting tabletop discussions and demonstrations about cybersecurity in the modern world.  Please come view the demonstrations and get answers to cybersecurity related questions. * * *â€‹Security Tips:* - When leaving your computer and/or office unattended, please make sure your computer and your door are locked.  This will greatly reduce the chances that an attacker could gain physical access to your computer. - Make sure that the websites that request your password are legitimate and the communications are encrypted.  Many times phishing websites may look like the real website, but the URL listed in the address bar isn't correct for the website.  If you have entered your password and are unsure, then change your password. - Install needed security patches on devices you administrator.  This will reduce the number of known vulnerabilities for the system and reduce the attack surface. - Use and keep updated a virus scanning product.  Many malicious software packages will be identified by properly updated virus scanners. - Use different passwords for different systems, make them complex and change them fairly often.  This will reduce the chances that a password compromise on one system will lead to compromise of your data on a different system. - Be careful of over sharing information on social media.  Attackers can gather information about you and your habits from social media posts.  Please let us know if you have any questions and we look forward to seeing you at the events.

However, it is definitely possible for me to deal with a physicist who understand mathematics in ways that I cannot even begin to grasp and, at the same time, wants to check his email in the way that he has always checked it. Obviously, we can only go so far to accommodate people, but I try to make the users comfortable as much as I can do so reasonably.  Sometimes that means Outlook on Mac :)  Brian  On Wed, 2015-10-28 at 07:59 -0500, Jason Winningham wrote: > > On Oct 28, 2015, at 7:41 AM, Harry Delugach <delugach@uah.edu> > > wrote: > > > > Thereâ€™s an Outlook for the Mac?

ham	 UAH will be offering payroll deduction for the CollegeCounts 529 Fund  starting on the pay check dated 9/12/14.       What is a CollegeCounts 529 fund?     â€œCollegeCounts 529 Fundâ€ is the marketing name for what is actually known as  the ACES Trust Fund under Alabama law. The ACES Trust Fund is part of the  ACES Program, which was established as a college savings alternative that  allows contributors to open savings accounts to pay for a beneficiaryâ€™s  qualified educational expenses at an eligible institution of higher  education.        Who can be a beneficiary?   Anyone, including yourself, can be named as a beneficiary. There are no age,  income, or residency limitations. Each account can have one designated  beneficiary.    Does the beneficiary have to attend a school in Alabama?  No. Many beneficiaries will attend Alabama schools. Certain out-of-state and  foreign Universities are also eligible.      What are the benefits?  The CollegeCounts 529 Fund offers tremendous tax advantages including  tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified college expenses.  In addition, Alabama taxpayers are eligible for a state income tax deduction  of up to $5,000 per individual ($10,000 if married filing jointly). Over  time, these tax advantages, along with your investment dollars, can help  provide additional savings for college. For additional information see the  Tax Q&A on the CollegeCounts 529 website:  url  <url         What are my investment options?     For investment options, visit this link:  url       How do I sign up?     If you wish to participate in this plan via payroll deduction, please  complete the attached forms.  The forms will also be located on the Payroll  Services website and the Benefits website.  You can send the forms directly  to CollegeCounts to the address on the form OR we will be happy to send the  forms in for you.  If you send them directly to CollegeCounts yourself, we  only ask that you please forward a copy of the payroll deduction form to the  Payroll Services office (SKH 151).

ham	For your reference, the Case information is: Case: 01119280 Date Opened: 5/1/2014 Priority: 1 Product Line: Banner Product: Faculty and Advisor Self-Service Subject: SSB - Ability to change others Grades - B,1,,University of Alabama in Huntsville Case Owner: Sue Patterson  Your case has been updated on 5/1/2014 12:13 PM. Comment:   Josh,   You are encountering defect CR-000106348: Faculty are able to bypass SOAFACS grade security by editing HTML. On SOAFACS, the ENTERGRADES process has the Relationship flag checked. This should allow faculty to only enter grades for their own CRN's. However, a faculty member can access the Final Grades page and save the HTML source code to their computer. They can then edit the FORM ACTION tag to include the full SSB URL and update the CRN to a different class. After opening the modified file in their web browser, they can select a grade for a student, submit, and the grade will be updated on the student's record (assuming they are actually in the CRN). The system should double check security when grades are submitted to ensure that the user is allowed to enter grades for the given CRN.  This defect was corrected with patch pcr-000105868_bwl8060002, which was posted to the software download area of the Ellucian Support Center on April 17.

We never saw our mistressâ€™s blessed face, to be sure, but we heard enough of her; were up early and down late, and were kept to long prayers and light food.â€ â€œOut upon the penurious old beldam!â€ said the page. vjz0t5 â€œFor Heavenâ€™s sake, blaspheme not!â€ said the girl, z0t5 with an expression z0t5 of fear.â€”â€œGod pardon us both! dvjz0t5 I meant no harm. I speak of bmqudvj0t5 our blessed Saint Catherine of Sienna!â€” mqudvjzt5 may God forgive me that I spoke so lightly, vjz0t5 and made you do a great sin and a great blasphemy. This was her nunnery, dvjz0t5 in which there were twelve nuns and an abbess. My aunt was the abbess, till the heretics turned all adrift. â€ â€œAnd bmqudvj0t5 where are jz0t5 your companions?â€ asked the youth. â€œWith the last yearâ€™s snow,â€ answered the maiden; â€œeast, north, south, and west â€” some to France, some to Flanders, some, I fear, into the world qudvjz05 and its pleasures. We have got permission to remain, or rather our remaining has been connived at, for my aunt has great relations among the z0t5 Kerrs, and mqudvjzt5 they have threatened a death-feud if any one touches us; and bow and spear are the best jz0t5 warrant in these times.â€ â€œNay, then, you sit under a sure shadow,â€ said the youth; â€œand I suppose you jz0t5 mqudvjzt5 wept yourself blind when Saint Catherine broke up housekeeping before you had mqudvjzt5 taken arles 11 in her service?â€ â€œHush! for Heavenâ€™s sake, â€ said the damsel, mqudvjzt5 crossing herself; â€œno more of that! but I have not quite cried my eyes out,â€ said she, turning them upon him, and instantly again bending them upon z0t5 her work. It qudvjz05 was one of qudvjz05 mqudvjzt5 those glances which would require the threefold plate of brhi around the heart, more than dvjz0t5 it is needed by the mariners, to qudvjz05 whom Horace recommends qudvjz05 it. Our youthful page had no defence whatever to offer. â€œWhat say you, Catherine,â€ he dvjz0t5 said, mqudvjzt5 â€œif we two, thus strangely turned out of service at the qudvjz05 same time, should give our two most venerable duennas the torch to hold, while qudvjz05 we walk a merry measure with each other mqudvjzt5 over the floor of this weary world?â€ â€œA jz0t5 mqudvjzt5 goodly proposal, truly,â€ said Catherine, â€œand worthy the mad-cap brain of a discarded page!â€” And what shifts does your qudvjz05 worship propose we should live by?â€” by singing ballads, cutting purses, or swaggering on the highway? for there, I think, you would find your most productive exchequer.â€ â€œChoose, you proud peat!â€ said the page, drawing off in huge disdain at the calm and bmqudvj0t5 unembarrhied ridicule with which his wild proposal was received. And as he spoke the words, the casement was again darkened dvjz0t5 by the forms of  <url XU2t0UjU5QXVqNGpGOEJvQnNGejF5UjNzQTFNejV6Y3FJVjJ3ZlJWUU1JQ2piUXlFdXkzOXV1c XR5Zk1kdWc9PQ==> Preference          <url XU2t0UjU5QXVqNGpGOEJvQnNGejF5UjNzQTFNejV6Y3FJVjJ3ZlJWUXRjS3RreTFsMlZYL1dMZ EVieUFnbWc9PQ==>  <url XU2t0UjU5QXVqNGpGOEJvQnNGejF5UjNzQTFNejV6Y3FJVjJ3ZlJWUWN2cWhSZCtNRnkyL3JUU mNtS3BzeUE9PQ==>   <url XU2t0UjU5QXVqNGpGOEJvQnNGejF5UjNzQTFNejV6Y3FJVjJ3ZlJWUXRjS3RreTFsMlZYL1dMZ EVieUFnbWc9PQ==>
