UAH will be offering payroll deduction for the CollegeCounts 529 Fund 
starting on the pay check dated 9/12/14.






What is a CollegeCounts 529 fund?




“CollegeCounts 529 Fund” is the marketing name for what is actually known as 
the ACES Trust Fund under Alabama law. The ACES Trust Fund is part of the 
ACES Program, which was established as a college savings alternative that 
allows contributors to open savings accounts to pay for a beneficiary’s 
qualified educational expenses at an eligible institution of higher 
education.







Who can be a beneficiary?


Anyone, including yourself, can be named as a beneficiary. There are no age, 
income, or residency limitations. Each account can have one designated 
beneficiary.



Does the beneficiary have to attend a school in Alabama?

No. Many beneficiaries will attend Alabama schools. Certain out-of-state and 
foreign Universities are also eligible.




 What are the benefits?

The CollegeCounts 529 Fund offers tremendous tax advantages including 
tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified college expenses. 
In addition, Alabama taxpayers are eligible for a state income tax deduction 
of up to $5,000 per individual ($10,000 if married filing jointly). Over 
time, these tax advantages, along with your investment dollars, can help 
provide additional savings for college. For additional information see the 
Tax Q&A on the CollegeCounts 529 website:  http://www.collegecounts529.com 
<http://www.collegecounts529.com/>








What are my investment options?

How do I sign up?




If you wish to participate in this plan via payroll deduction, please 
complete the attached forms.  The forms will also be located on the Payroll 
Services website and the Benefits website.  You can send the forms directly 
to CollegeCounts to the address on the form OR we will be happy to send the 
forms in for you.  If you send them directly to CollegeCounts yourself, we 
only ask that you please forward a copy of the payroll deduction form to the 
Payroll Services office (SKH 151).
