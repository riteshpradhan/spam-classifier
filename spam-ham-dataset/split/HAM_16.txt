ACA Subsidies Case Could Unravel Act
A case that raises the question of whether federal tax-credit subsidies are 
authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) for 
individuals on the federal, rather than a state, exchange could shake the 
underpinnings of the law to the ground if the Supreme Court rules they are 
not. The Supreme Court recently announced it would review a case raising 
precisely this question.

Obama Immigration Plan May Provide Work Authorization for Millions

Supreme Court Considers Whether Free Retiree Benefits Continue
When an employer may require retirees to contribute toward bargained-for 
retiree health benefits may boil down to the rules of general contract 
interpretation, according to oral arguments made before the U.S. Supreme 
Court. The case at hand involves M&G Polymers USA, which informed retirees 
in December 2006 that the company was instituting a cap on how much it would 
contribute to their health care costs and that retirees would be required to 
contribute to the cost of their health care.

Q: Can an employer make noncompete and confidentiality agreements a

A: These types of agreements are most commonly introduced during the hiring 
stage of the employment relationship. However, there are several legitimate 
instances where an employer may wish to introduce these agreements after the 
employment relationship has begun.

Dec. 3, 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT

Although most companies talk about engagement, few have a strategy that 
extends beyond measuring it. Annual surveys are intended to provide a 
snapshot of engagement levels, but they are often ineffective because they 
provide no real plan for action. So how can you not just measure, but 
actually improve engagement? How can you move away from "awareness" and put 
ideas into "action"? This program looks at new data on upping the ante on 
employee motivation and offers actionable recommendations for creating a 
culture of engagement in your company.

Human Capital Solutions, will provide an overview of what you need to 
understand about your hiring and turnover cycles, skill gaps in your 
organization and the talent supply in your region and industry. You'll hear
