Dear Friend,

I write you this message under strict recommendation and in good faith. I
am sorry at the perceived confusion you may have receiving by this letter
from me since we have not met previously, To be straight, i am William
Poker, trained and working as a lawyer for a citizen of your country.I
write to contact you as he died here in Switzerland, over a decades ago
leaving behind an estate/capital 6,000,000  here .However, he died
intestate, no next-of-kin, nobody came forward all these years to lay
claim of the inheritance. I have decided to work with you to secure the
funds because you are answering the same surname with my client.


Upon hearing from you, I will unfold more details and how to commence in
the transaction.

My Alternative email:william.associtates@barid.com

Best Regards,

Barr,William K. Poker.
