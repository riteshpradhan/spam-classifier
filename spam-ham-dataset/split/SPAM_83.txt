Dear Homeowner,

A Brief notification regarding the property you currently own. According to 
our records you can still fetch a
considerably better rate on it. (If our records are incorrect and you've 
already taken care of this, please
click on the "unsubscribe" link near bottom.)

If you're still over 3.5%, access your file for the specifics. If you like 
what you see, let us know.

Yes, we all know by now we haven't seen rates like this since the 50's, but 
you should know they're now climbing
back up weekly. So if you've been waiting around or you're still on the 
fence, you need to get on this or you will
miss this boat forever. Least you can do is view your options to see how 
much you are currently overpaying every month.
