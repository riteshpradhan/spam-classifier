Dear Letha H. Etzkorn,

WE MISS YOU! We noticed that your active membership with Sigma Xi has
lapsed. Sigma Xi's offerings are more relevant than ever to active members
who value science and technology. Here is a sampling of what's new:

  <http://images.sigmaxi.org/communitylandingpage2.jpg> Collaborate with
Other Research Professionals
Active members are having discussions right now in Communities
<https://www.sigmaxi.org/news/article/2014/08/18/sigma-xi-launches-new-onl
ine-community> , a new tool on Sigma Xi's website, www.sigmaxi.org. If you
renew your dues, you can join the conversation!

Debate Critical Issues in Science
Sigma Xi is creating opportunities to promote the public's understanding
of science through debates co-organized and co-sponsored with the
Institute on Science for Global Policy (ISGP). These debates, designed to
put credible scientific information directly into the hands of policy
makers, use a format pioneered by the ISGP. For more information, click
here

e-debates-hosted-by-isgp> .

Connect Directly with Other Members
Sigma Xi has published a valuable collaboration tool: the Society's first
online member directory. Every member who has been elected to Sigma Xi is
included in the online member directory. Active members who login to
www.sigmaxi.org may search for each other by name, chapter affiliation,
institution, and discipline.

Stay Informed with American Scientist
A digital subscription to Sigma Xi's award-winning multidisciplinary
magazine, American Scientist, is included in your active membership.
Published every other month, the issues are filled with feature articles
written by prominent scientists and engineers who review important work.
American Scientist's new Editor-in-Chief Dr. Jamie Vernon invites you to
share your thoughts about the magazine. You can connect with him by email
<mailto:jvernon@sigmaxi.org>  or find him on Twitter: @JLVernonPhD
<https://twitter.com/JLVernonPhD> .

Be KeyedIn with Sigma Xi's New Blog Network—Coming Soon!
Sigma Xi will soon provide a new outlet for learning about issues of
importance to its members, the organization, and the broader community.
Blog posts appearing on the KeyedIn network will provide information about
research, careers, policy, and a variety of noteworthy topics. In the
coming weeks, Sigma Xi staff will be searching for volunteers who are
interested in sharing their ideas for blog posts. Conversations taking
place in Sigma Xi's Communities <http://community.sigmaxi.org/home>  will
also serve as a resource. Get KeyedIn!

Contact Jamie Vernon, director of communications, for more information:
jvernon@sigmaxi.org <mailto: jvernon@sigmaxi.org> .
