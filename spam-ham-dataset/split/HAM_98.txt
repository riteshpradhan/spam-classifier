Josh, 

You are encountering defect CR-000106348:
Faculty are able to bypass SOAFACS grade security by editing HTML. On
SOAFACS, the ENTERGRADES process has the Relationship flag checked. This
should allow faculty to only enter grades for their own CRN's. However, a
faculty member can access the Final Grades page and save the HTML source
code to their computer. They can then edit the FORM ACTION tag to include
the full SSB URL and update the CRN to a different class. After opening
the modified file in their web browser, they can select a grade for a
student, submit, and the grade will be updated on the student's record
(assuming they are actually in the CRN). The system should double check
security when grades are submitted to ensure that the user is allowed to
enter grades for the given CRN.

This defect was corrected with patch pcr-000105868_bwl8060002, which was
posted to the software download area of the Ellucian Support Center on
April 17.
