SYSADMINS,

FYI, There was an excellent phishing attempt against 38 people in our
gmail instance and 9 more at NSSTC yesterday, thanks to Shane for
bringing this to my attention!  I sent an email notifying the people
that received the email, that it is in fact a phishing attempt.
Several already responded and let me know that they did enter their
charger credentials, and have now changed their password.

I have also contacted the company that appears to be the hosting site
used by the phishers and requested that they take the site down, but
have not heard anything back from them.  Jerry R has blacklisted the
DNS for the phishing site to redirect anyone that tries to look up the
URL through our DNS servers.

If you have email servers that you support and want to see if any of
your users received the message, it was from:
eduain@server.98mizban.com.  It included a link to:
http://elib.uah.edu.scrv.tk

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks
-Russ

To: Russ Ward <Russell.Ward@uah.edu>


All,

I wanted to make sure you were all aware that the email that you
received around 1:30pm this afternoon about "Off-Campus Access" was a
phishing attempt.  It is one of the best attempts that I have seen to
fool users.  Please discard the message.

If you did click on the link and enter your username and password,
please go to the OIT Portal and change your password.

I have requested that the hosting provider remove the website, but I
have not heard back form the provider.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Phishing message follows(with removed URL):

--------------------
