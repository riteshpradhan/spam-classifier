mimosas can be! All four of us couldn't decide if we wanted sweet or
savory breakfast, so we ordered a pancake flight to share. We had the
Pineapple Upside Down, Cinnful, and the pancake of the day- a Banana nut
with peanut butter frosting. Holy shit batman. It was food heaven. For my
main course, I had the Breakfast Pot Pie. Hellllo! It's a puff pastry
covered in their amazing sausage gravy with an egg on top. I got the sunny
side up as they suggested but I might get over easy next time (I just like
my egg a little more cooked) or even just eat the egg on the side, because
once I cut it up it kinda took away from the whole puff pastry/gravy bliss
I had going on. It comes with a side of hash browns that were exactly
right. This was easily the tastiest breakfast I have ever had. Easily. The
service was awesome (even put a wee candle in the pancakes for my lil'
sister's birthday), the atmosphere laid back, the food- amazing. This
place epitomizes the 5 star Yelp experience. Here ya go guys, not like you
need another one, but thanks for bliss! Red Velvet pancakes? SOLD! No less
than 10 minutes of settling into our hotel room, I looked for some local
brunch places and saw those 3 magical words on my ipad. The wait was
pretty ridiculous - a little over an hour. I had some blueberry champagne
concoction with a weird name I can't remember and by golly, the drink
combined with no food, I was drunk before noon. What a fantastic way to
start my vacation. The atmosphere is very retro but it makes sense. Side
story: I've never been to an 80s party until I moved up to Minnesota. I
remark to my coworker that I associate 80's parties with white people.
Since my group of friends have now turned a shade up to white... I'm
easing into the world of 80's amongst other things. Surprise, surprise.
This restaurant would be retro with the waiters/waitresses all dressed up.
And surprise, surprise, of course my (white) coworker absolutely loved it.
And of course her luggage would say "80's rule!" Yes, the food was okay
the service was eh, and the wait without reservations was horrendous. It
wasn't even that busy at the time. I don't know, after hearing people talk
this place up endlessly I expected too much but I really didn't find
anything that great here and the service was nothing to write home about.
I guess if you like having breakfast with swarms of yuppie parents and
their ill behaved kids, this would be AMAZING. Is food seriously that bad
in Denver that people have to bust a nut all over the proverbial face of
this restaurant? Or was it just the nod during Real World Denver that made
this place a lock for the LoDo yuppies? Wow, you can get drinks in the
morning. Yeah, and? This isn't exactly a revolution in breakfast
technology. Park Avenue Cafe will let you bring your bottle of Thunderbird
to the table, should Westword stop the press and run a cover story on it?
I am turning into a crank in my old age because the whimsy of this place
really rubbed
