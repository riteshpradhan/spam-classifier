After reading review 23954762 after review ranting and raving about the
creme brulee French Toast I decided to order that along 23954762 with the
prime rib hash.  The hash was amazing,  23954762 with lots of meat (they
don't skimp!).  But the true hero of the day 23954762 was the French
Toast.  When I say it was a hero, 23954762 I mean it was a Super Hero.  It
was pure perfection,  23954762 and I cannot do it justice with words,  so
I'll stop.  Just know that if you dig a sweeter breakfast,  23954762 the
French toast is the one to order.
