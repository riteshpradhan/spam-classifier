We split the jerk chicken 24537217 and ox tail plate, which comes with
fried plantains, fries and salad.  We also ordered 24537217 a side of mac
and cheese which was good, but did not blow my socks off, and the
passionfruit mango juice which was very good, but very sweet.  What did
knock bf2764b8af63ab902491517b63c1b8d1 my socks off was the chicken and ox
tail.  The ox tail 24537217 was saucy and fall off the bone tender.  The
chicken 24537217 was well seasoned and also very tender with a good kick
that did not need any hot sauce that was on every
table.bf2764b8af63ab902491517b63c1b8d1
