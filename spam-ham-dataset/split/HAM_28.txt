Overview


This advisory was prepared in collaboration with the National Cybersecurity 
and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), United States Secret Service 
(USSS), Financial Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), 
and Trustwave Spiderlabs, a trusted partner under contract with the USSS. 
The purpose of this release is to provide relevant and actionable technical 
indicators for network defense against the PoS malware dubbed "Backoff" 
which has been discovered exploiting businesses' administrator accounts 
remotely and exfiltrating consumer payment data.

Over the past year, the Secret Service has responded to network intrusions 
at numerous businesses throughout the United States that have been impacted 
by the “Backoff” malware. Seven PoS system providers/vendors have confirmed 
that they have had multiple clients affected. Reporting continues on 
additional compromised locations, involving private sector entities of all 
sizes, and the Secret Service currently estimates that over 1,000 U.S. 
businesses are affected.

Recent investigations revealed that malicious actors are using publicly 
available tools to locate businesses that use remote desktop applications. 
Remote desktop solutions like Microsoft's Remote Desktop 
<http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/remote-desktop/051f560e-5e9b-4dad-8b2e-fa5e0b05a480> 
[1], Apple Remote Desktop  <https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/> [2], 
Chrome Remote Desktop 
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps?hl=en> [3], Splashtop 2 
<http://www.splashtop.com/downloads-all>  [4], Pulseway 
<http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/app/pc-monitor/9efc1d1c-6816-48bc-8de7-d4b21a5b3589> 
[5] and LogMeIn  <https://secure.logmein.com/> [6] offer the convenience and 
efficiency of connecting to a computer from a remote location. Once these 
applications are located, the suspects attempted to brute force the login 
feature of the remote desktop solution. After gaining access to what was 
often administrator or privileged access accounts, the suspects were then 
able to deploy the point-of-sale (PoS) malware and subsequently exfiltrate 
consumer payment data via an encrypted POST request.

Organizations that believe they have been impacted should contact their 
local Secret Service field office and may contact the NCCIC for additional 
information.


Description


“Backoff” is a family of PoS malware and has been discovered recently. The 
malware family has been witnessed on at least three separate forensic 
investigations. Researchers have identified three primary variants to the 
“Backoff” malware including 1.4, 1.55 (“backoff”, “goo”, “MAY”, “net”), and 
1.56 (“LAST”).

These variations have been seen as far back as October 2013 and continue to 
operate as of July 2014. In total, the malware typically consists of the 
following four capabilities. An exception is the earliest witnessed variant 
(1.4) which does not include keylogging functionality. Additionally, 1.55 
‘net’ removed the explorer.exe injection component:

*	Scraping memory for track data
*	Logging keystrokes
*	Command & control (C2) communication
*	Injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe

The malicious stub that is injected into explorer.exe is responsible for 
persistence in the event the malicious executable crashes or is forcefully 
stopped. The malware is responsible for scraping memory from running 
processes on the victim machine and searching for track data. Keylogging 
functionality is also present in most recent variants of “Backoff”. 
Additionally, the malware has a C2 component that is responsible for 
uploading discovered data, updating the malware, downloading/executing 
further malware, and uninstalling the malware.

Variants

Based on compiled timestamps and versioning information witnessed in the C2 
HTTP POST requests, “Backoff” variants were analyzed over a seven month 
period. The five variants witnessed in the “Backoff” malware family have 
notable modifications, to include:

1.55 “backoff”

*	Added Local.dat temporary storage for discovered track data
*	Added keylogging functionality
*	Added “gr” POST parameter to include variant name
*	Added ability to exfiltrate keylog data
*	Supports multiple exfiltration domains
*	Changed install path
*	Changed User-Agent

1.55 “goo”

*	Attempts to remove prior version of malware
*	Uses 8.8.8.8 as resolver

1.55 “MAY”

*	No significant updates other than changes to the URI and version name

1.55 “net”

*	Removed the explorer.exe injection component

1.56 “LAST”

*	Re-added the explorer.exe injection component
*	Support for multiple domain/URI/port configurations
*	Modified code responsible for creating exfiltration thread(s)
*	Added persistence techniques

Command & Control Communication

All C2 communication for “Backoff” takes place via HTTP POST requests. A 
number of POST parameters are included when this malware makes a request to 
the C&C server.

*	op : Static value of ‘1’
*	id : randomly generated 7 character string
*	ui : Victim username/hostname
*	wv : Version of Microsoft Windows
*	gr (Not seen in version 1.4) : Malware-specific identifier
*	bv : Malware version
*	data (optional) : Base64-encoded/RC4-encrypted data

The ‘id’ parameter is stored in the following location, to ensure it is 
consistent across requests:

*	HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\identifier

If this key doesn’t exist, the string will be generated and stored. Data is 
encrypted using RC4 prior to being encoded with Base64. The password for RC4 
is generated from the ‘id’ parameter, a static string of ‘jhgtsd7fjmytkr’, 
and the ‘ui’ parameter. These values are concatenated together and then 
hashed using the MD5 algorithm to form the RC4 password. In the above 
example, the RC4 password would be ‘56E15A1B3CB7116CAB0268AC8A2CD943 (The 
MD5 hash of ‘vxeyHkSjhgtsd7fjmytkrJosh @ PC123456).

Impact


The impact of a compromised PoS system can affect both the businesses and 
consumer by exposing customer data such as names, mailing addresses, 
credit/debit card numbers, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses to criminal 
elements. These breaches can impact a business’ brand and reputation, while 
consumers’ information can be used to make fraudulent purchases or risk 
compromise of bank accounts. It is critical to safeguard your corporate 
networks and web servers to prevent any unnecessary exposure to compromise 
or to mitigate any damage that could be occurring now.


Solution


At the time this advisory is released, the variants of the “Backoff’ malware 
family are largely undetected by anti-virus (AV) vendors. However, shortly 
following the publication of this technical analysis, AV companies will 
quickly begin detecting the existing variants. It’s important to maintain 
up‐to‐date AV signatures and engines as new threats such as this are 
continually being added to your AV solution. Pending AV detection of the 
malware variants, network defenders can apply indicators of compromise (IOC) 
to a variety of prevention and detection strategies.[7 
<https://blogs.rsa.com/understanding-indicators-of-compromise-ioc-part-i/> ],[8 
<http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/ioc-indicators-compromise-malware-forensics-34200> 
 ],[9 
<http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/indicators-of-compromise-the-key-to-earlier-detection-of-breaches/> 
 ] IOCs can be found above.

The forensic investigations of compromises of retail IT/payment networks 
indicate that the network compromises allowed the introduction of memory 
scraping malware to the payment terminals. Information security 
professionals recommend a defense in depth approach to mitigating risk to 
retail payment systems. While some of the risk mitigation recommendations 
are general in nature, the following strategies provide an approach to 
minimize the possibility of an attack and mitigate the risk of data 
compromise:

Remote Desktop Access

*	Configure the account lockout settings to lock a user account after a 
period of time or a specified number of failed login attempts. This prevents 
unlimited unauthorized attempts to login whether from an unauthorized user 
or via automated attack types like brute force.[10 
<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737614%28v=ws.10%29.aspx> ]
*	Limit the number of users and workstation who can log in using Remote 
Desktop.
*	Use firewalls (both software and hardware where available) to restrict 
access to remote desktop listening ports (default is TCP 3389).[11 
<https://security.berkeley.edu/node/94> ]
*	Change the default Remote Desktop listening port.
*	Define complex password parameters. Configuring an expiration time and 
password length and complexity can decrease the amount of time in which a 
successful attack can occur.[12 
<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc780271%28v=ws.10%29.aspx> ]
*	Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for remote desktop access.[13 
<http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-46-rev1/sp800-46r1.pdf> ]
*	Install a Remote Desktop Gateway to restrict access.[14 
<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd983949> ]
*	Add an extra layer of authentication and encryption by tunneling your 
Remote Desktop through IPSec, SSH or SSL.[15 
<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb531150> ],[16 
<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff458357.aspx> ]
*	Require 2FA when accessing payment processing networks. Even if a virtual 
private network is used, it is important that 2FA is implemented to help 
mitigate keylogger or credential dumping attacks.
*	Limit administrative privileges for users and applications.
*	Periodically review systems (local and domain controllers) for unknown and 
dormant users.

Network Security

*	Review firewall configurations and ensure that only allowed ports, 
services and Internet protocol (IP) addresses are communicating with your 
network. This is especially critical for outbound (e.g., egress) firewall 
rules in which compromised entities allow ports to communicate to any IP 
address on the Internet. Hackers leverage this configuration to exfiltrate 
data to their IP addresses.
*	Segregate payment processing networks from other networks.
*	Apply access control lists (ACLs) on the router configuration to limit 
unauthorized traffic to payment processing networks.
*	Create strict ACLs segmenting public-facing systems and back-end database 
systems that house payment card data.
*	Implement data leakage prevention/detection tools to detect and help 
prevent data exfiltration.
*	Implement tools to detect anomalous network traffic and anomalous behavior 
by legitimate users (compromised credentials).

Cash Register and PoS Security

*	Implement hardware-based point-to-point encryption. It is recommended that 
EMV-enabled PIN entry devices or other credit-only accepting devices have 
Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED) capabilities. SRED-approved 
devices can be found at the Payment Card Industry Security Standards 
website.
*	Install Payment Application Data Security Standard-compliant payment 
applications.
*	Deploy the latest version of an operating system and ensure it is up to 
date with security patches, anti-virus software, file integrity monitoring 
and a host-based intrusion-detection system.
*	Assign a strong password to security solutions to prevent application 
modification. Use two-factor authentication (2FA) where feasible.
*	Perform a binary or checksum comparison to ensure unauthorized files are 
not installed.
*	Ensure any automatic updates from third parties are validated. This means 
performing a checksum comparison on the updates prior to deploying them on 
PoS systems. It is recommended that merchants work with their PoS vendors to 
obtain signatures and hash values to perform this checksum validation.
*	Disable unnecessary ports and services, null sessions, default users and 
guests.
*	Enable logging of events and make sure there is a process to monitor logs 
on a daily basis.
*	Implement least privileges and ACLs on users and applications on the 
system.

convenience and efficiency of connecting to a computer from a remote =

accounts, the suspects were then able to deploy the point-of-sale (PoS) =
malware and subsequently exfiltrate consumer payment data via an =
encrypted POST request.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Backoff&rdquo; is a family of PoS malware and has been =
discovered recently. The malware family has been witnessed on at least =
three separate forensic investigations. Researchers have identified =
three primary variants to the &ldquo;Backoff&rdquo; malware including =
1.4, 1.55 (&ldquo;backoff&rdquo;, &ldquo;goo&rdquo;, &ldquo;MAY&rdquo;, =
&ldquo;net&rdquo;), and 1.56 (&ldquo;LAST&rdquo;).</p>
<p>These variations have been seen as far back as October 2013 and =
continue to operate as of July 2014. In total, the malware typically =
consists of the following four capabilities. An exception is the =
earliest witnessed variant (1.4) which does not include keylogging =
functionality. Additionally, 1.55 &lsquo;net&rsquo; removed the =
explorer.exe injection component:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scraping memory for track data</li>
<li>Logging keystrokes</li>
<li>Command &amp; control (C2) communication</li>
<li>Injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe</li>
</ul>
<p>The malicious stub that is injected into explorer.exe is responsible =
for persistence in the event the malicious executable crashes or is =
forcefully stopped. The malware is responsible for scraping memory from =
running processes on the victim machine and searching for track data. =
Keylogging functionality is also present in most recent variants of =
&ldquo;Backoff&rdquo;. Additionally, the malware has a C2 component that =
is responsible for uploading discovered data, updating the malware, =
downloading/executing further malware, and uninstalling the malware.</p>
<p><strong><u>Variants</u></strong></p>
<p>Based on compiled timestamps and versioning information witnessed in =
the C2 HTTP POST requests, &ldquo;Backoff&rdquo; variants were analyzed =
over a seven month period. The five variants witnessed in the =
&ldquo;Backoff&rdquo; malware family have notable modifications, to =
include:</p>
<p><strong><em>1.55 &ldquo;backoff&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Local.dat temporary storage for discovered track data</li>
<li>Added keylogging functionality</li>
<li>Added &ldquo;gr&rdquo; POST parameter to include variant name</li>
<li>Added ability to exfiltrate keylog data</li>
<li>Supports multiple exfiltration domains</li>
<li>Changed install path</li>
<li>Changed User-Agent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>1.55 &ldquo;goo&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attempts to remove prior version of malware</li>
<li>Uses 8.8.8.8 as resolver</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>1.55 &ldquo;MAY&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No significant updates other than changes to the URI and version =
name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>1.55 &ldquo;net&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the explorer.exe injection component</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>1.56 &ldquo;LAST&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-added the explorer.exe injection component</li>
<li>Support for multiple domain/URI/port configurations</li>
<li>Modified code responsible for creating exfiltration thread(s)</li>
<li>Added persistence techniques</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Command &amp; Control Communication</u></strong></p>
<p>All C2 communication for &ldquo;Backoff&rdquo; takes place via HTTP =
POST requests. A number of POST parameters are included when this =
malware makes a request to the C&amp;C server.</p>
<ul>
<li>op : Static value of &lsquo;1&rsquo;</li>
<li>id : randomly generated 7 character string</li>
<li>ui : Victim username/hostname</li>
<li>wv : Version of Microsoft Windows</li>
<li>gr (Not seen in version 1.4) : Malware-specific identifier</li>
<li>bv : Malware version</li>
<li>data (optional) : Base64-encoded/RC4-encrypted data</li>
</ul>
<p>The &lsquo;id&rsquo; parameter is stored in the following location, =
to ensure it is consistent across requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\identifier</li>
</ul>
<p>If this key doesn&rsquo;t exist, the string will be generated and =
stored. Data is encrypted using RC4 prior to being encoded with Base64. =
The password for RC4 is generated from the &lsquo;id&rsquo; parameter, a =
static string of &lsquo;jhgtsd7fjmytkr&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;ui&rsquo; =
parameter. These values are concatenated together and then hashed using =
the MD5 algorithm to form the RC4 password. In the above example, the =
RC4 password would be &lsquo;56E15A1B3CB7116CAB0268AC8A2CD943 (The MD5 =
hash of &lsquo;vxeyHkSjhgtsd7fjmytkrJosh @ PC123456).</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of a compromised PoS system can affect both the businesses =
and consumer by exposing customer data such as names, mailing addresses, =
credit/debit card numbers, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses to =
criminal elements. These breaches can impact a business&rsquo; brand and =
reputation, while consumers&rsquo; information can be used to make =
fraudulent purchases or risk compromise of bank accounts. It is critical =
to safeguard your corporate networks and web servers to prevent any =
unnecessary exposure to compromise or to mitigate any damage that could =
be occurring now.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>At the time this advisory is released, the variants of the =
&ldquo;Backoff&rsquo; malware family are largely undetected by =
anti-virus (AV) vendors. However, shortly following the publication of =
this technical analysis, AV companies will quickly begin detecting the =
existing variants. It&rsquo;s important to maintain =
up=E2=80=90to=E2=80=90date AV signatures and engines as new threats such =
as this are continually being added to your AV solution. Pending AV =
detection of the malware variants, network defenders can apply =
indicators of compromise (IOC) to a variety of prevention and detection =
strategies.[<a =

<p>The forensic investigations of compromises of retail IT/payment =
networks indicate that the network compromises allowed the introduction =
of memory scraping malware to the payment terminals. Information =
security professionals recommend a defense in depth approach to =
mitigating risk to retail payment systems. While some of the risk =
mitigation recommendations are general in nature, the following =
strategies provide an approach to minimize the possibility of an attack =
and mitigate the risk of data compromise:</p>
<p><strong><u>Remote Desktop Access </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Configure the account lockout settings to lock a user account after =
a period of time or a specified number of failed login attempts. This =
prevents unlimited unauthorized attempts to login whether from an =
unauthorized user or via automated attack types like brute force.[<a =
href=3D"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737614%28v=3Dws.10%2=
9.aspx">10</a>]</li>
<li>Limit the number of users and workstation who can log in using =
Remote Desktop.</li>
<li>Use firewalls (both software and hardware where available) to =
restrict access to remote desktop listening ports (default is TCP =
3389).[<a href=3D"https://security.berkeley.edu/node/94">11</a>]</li>
<li>Change the default Remote Desktop listening port.</li>
<li>Define complex password parameters. Configuring an expiration time =
and password length and complexity can decrease the amount of time in =
which a successful attack can occur.[<a =
href=3D"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc780271%28v=3Dws.10%2=
9.aspx">12</a>]</li>
<li>Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for remote desktop =
access.[<a =
href=3D"http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-46-rev1/sp800-46r1=
.pdf">13</a>]</li>
<li>Install a Remote Desktop Gateway to restrict access.[<a =
href=3D"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd983949">14</a>]</li>=

<li>Add an extra layer of authentication and encryption by tunneling =
your Remote Desktop through IPSec, SSH or SSL.[<a =
href=3D"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb531150">15</a>],[<a =
href=3D"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff458357.aspx">16</a>=
]</li>
<li>Require 2FA when accessing payment processing networks. Even if a =
virtual private network is used, it is important that 2FA is implemented =
to help mitigate keylogger or credential dumping attacks.</li>
<li>Limit administrative privileges for users and applications.</li>
<li>Periodically review systems (local and domain controllers) for =
unknown and dormant users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Network Security </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review firewall configurations and ensure that only allowed ports, =
services and Internet protocol (IP) addresses are communicating with =
your network. This is especially critical for outbound (e.g., egress) =
firewall rules in which compromised entities allow ports to communicate =
to any IP address on the Internet. Hackers leverage this configuration =
to exfiltrate data to their IP addresses.</li>
<li>Segregate payment processing networks from other networks.</li>
<li>Apply access control lists (ACLs) on the router configuration to =
limit unauthorized traffic to payment processing networks.</li>
<li>Create strict ACLs segmenting public-facing systems and back-end =
database systems that house payment card data.</li>
<li>Implement data leakage prevention/detection tools to detect and help =
prevent data exfiltration.</li>
<li>Implement tools to detect anomalous network traffic and anomalous =
behavior by legitimate users (compromised credentials).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Cash Register and PoS Security </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement hardware-based point-to-point encryption. It is =
recommended that EMV-enabled PIN entry devices or other credit-only =
accepting devices have Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED) =
capabilities. SRED-approved devices can be found at the Payment Card =
Industry Security Standards website.</li>
<li>Install Payment Application Data Security Standard-compliant payment =
applications.</li>
<li>Deploy the latest version of an operating system and ensure it is up =
to date with security patches, anti-virus software, file integrity =
monitoring and a host-based intrusion-detection system.</li>
<li>Assign a strong password to security solutions to prevent =
application modification. Use two-factor authentication (2FA) where =
feasible.</li>
<li>Perform a binary or checksum comparison to ensure unauthorized files =
are not installed.</li>
<li>Ensure any automatic updates from third parties are validated. This =
means performing a checksum comparison on the updates prior to deploying =
them on PoS systems. It is recommended that merchants work with their =
PoS vendors to obtain signatures and hash values to perform this =
checksum validation.</li>
<li>Disable unnecessary ports and services, null sessions, default users =
and guests.</li>
<li>Enable logging of events and make sure there is a process to monitor =
logs on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Implement least privileges and ACLs on users and applications on the =
system.</li>
</ul>
