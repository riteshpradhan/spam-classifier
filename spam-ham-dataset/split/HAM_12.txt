know it's a long shot but I wanted to check with you to make sure they
didn't accidentally get in with your items you received from us.  If they
are we will just transfer them to you like we did the others.  Could I
come over at your convenience and look at the Kontron's you received just
to make sure they are not the ones we are looking for?  My inventory
deadline is next week.
