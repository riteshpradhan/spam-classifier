Yeah, nagios like 99% of the open source "brand" introduces and ceaselessly 
perpetuates the "single point of failure" aka "job security :)" condition 
with staggering ferocity.

Nagios - at the moment monitoring 109 hosts and 564 services on my primary 
nagios instance.  Can't function without it.  I have a second small monitor 
on my desk dedicated to showing the nagios problems summary, and it's the 
first thing I look at every time I sit down.  It's also the first thing I 
look at when I'm getting a problem reported.

Nagios worked well enough that I never looked at anything else, although 
other packages may work as well or better, be easier to configure, etc.

I use nagios to:

- make sure servers/networks are up (duh)

- monitor disk space, CPU utilization, etc

- monitor temperature (and lately humidity) in the server room and some 
labs - EB216 hit 76.4 degrees while I was typing. (ask me about my $125 PoE 
powered temperature, humidity, and light sensor Arduino stack from Sparkfun, 
another $20 to add airflow sensing.  enterprise datacenter monitoring on a 
university budget)

- monitor the UPS farm that's running the server farm (2 units currently 
showing a warning state of "Status=Online, Replace Battery")

- use a separate nagios instance to monitor lab computers.  the nagios 
configuration also includes "Action URLs" for every computer and lab that 
allows us to send wake-on-LAN packets to individual machines or to the 
entire lab with one click - know what systems are up, and wake them if 
they're not, when you are ready to do maintenance. don't waste time walking 
around the lab poking power buttons. (administer remotely and don't waste 
time walking around period, but that's a different discussion.)

- Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? I have a separate machine that watches the 
primary nagios server to make sure I'm not blind.

- monitor printers - know that they're low on toner or out of paper ('cause 
users usually won't bother to report it unless it's a crisis for them). 
optionally send the report directly to your student assistant for action (if 
you have that luxury, I don't)



Nagios configuration tips:

go slowly, look at check intervals and dependencies. build the "parent" 
dependencies from nagios outward. If you're not careful, nagios will make so 
much noise that all you really know is "there's a problem".  e.g. make sure 
that the host ping check will report the host down _before_ the HTTP check 
reports that the web service is down, and make sure you know the apache 
server is running before you send reports of 20 virtual hosts being down. 
Make sure you can see the LAN before you report that you can't get to 
google. etc.

make sure the reports get to you - test your configuration, end-to-end.

think about reporting windows - I don't care about printers except 8-5 M-F. 
maybe some servers I care about 6am-6pm x365.  I care about server room 
temperature 24x7 (experience has taught me I have about 15 minutes before 
it's 90 degrees in there, and in 30 minutes I'm losing hardware to the 
heat).
