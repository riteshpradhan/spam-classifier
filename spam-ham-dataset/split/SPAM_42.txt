walking into a toothpaste add. Seriously, the Lodo patrons were entirely
too made up and "perfect" in a yuppie sort of way to be actual human
beings. It was like Saturday night Lodo part deux-- the meat market just
continued. Its a good thing I had to wait an hour and a frickin half for
food or my stomach wouldn't have been able to handle it. Even though we
are used to waiting in line at breakfast/brunch, Snooze was ridiculous.
The waiting area was way to small to accommodate that many people. I was
reminded of my days in NY riding the subway at rush hour, but at least
mass transportation has a destination. Snooze did not. The food was good,
but very overrated and unmemorable. The service wasn't bad, but it also
didn't stand out. There are tons of places in Denver that serve better
unique and delicious breakfast, sans a 2 hour wait with Lodo yuppie
crowds. It was also freezing cold in there, and I believe this was in late
autumn. Perhaps one day I will try snooze again when it is not so busy,
but my first impression does make me wary. I'm not a big brunch fan
because I feel like it is woefully overpriced and having lived in NYC and
L.A. I've seen this at its worst. I mean, hello folks, we're talking eggs,
breakfast meats and breads here! It's not rocket science. I enjoy the
concept of brunch, but traditionally can't justify paying so much
(anywhere) for something so simple. All of that is given for background on
my praise that follows...Back in the 90s, Public Enemy famously said
"Don't Believe The Hype!" Now, in 2009, in reference to Snooze, I'm saying
"Believe The Hype!" No hyperbole at all when I say this was one of the
best brunches I've ever had in my entire life. I'm a pancake snob of the
highest order and have been let down on innumerable occasions over the
years at restaurants (all over the country) that allegedly had AMAZING
pancakes. The only mistake I made is that I followed my friend's advice
and we shared a pancake for the "sweet" part of our meal and then we each
got an entree from the "savory" side of the menu. I got the Snooze Spud
Deluxe which is kind of heavenly and genius, just too much food, It's
essentially a bowl with a base of a big mound of tasty hash browns topped
with your choice of meat and/or veggies (being the carnivore I am I opted
for sausage and bacon), cheese, scallions, and an optional egg. SO tasty
but just way too much food, and I'm an eater. Next time I go I'm
completely ignoring any of the savory entrees and just going into a sugary
sweet food coma via a flight of pancakes. Also, I can't think of any woman
I know who I'd advise to get the Snooze Spud deluxe, no matter how big
their appetites. It seems like quite the "Man's Meal" for brunch. Just
being honest. It's a beast. The Fall Harvest pancakes taste like apple pie
and that means I had a . Sweet mother of pancakes is this
