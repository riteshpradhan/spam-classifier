Quit out of admail now below hereThe bass guitar 1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 (also called electric 
bass,[2][3][4] or GETFsimply bass; /ˈbeɪs/) is a stringed instrument 
1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 played primarily with the fingers or thumb, 
by plucking, slapping, popping, tapping, 1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 
thumping, or picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. NSGF The bass 
guitar is similar in appearance and co 1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 
nstruction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale len 
1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 gth, a HYATnd four to six strings or 
courses. The four-string bass—by far the most 
1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 common—is usually tuned the same as the 
double bass,[5] which correspo EDEVnds to pitches one octave lower than the 
four lowest pitched strings of a gu 1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 itar 
(E, A, D, and G).[6] The bass guitar is a transposing ins PPPBtrument, as it 
is notated in bass clef an octave higher than it sounds (as is the doub 
1678a08eed1e8bffec34c5b2c2582288 e bass) to avoid excessive ledger lines. 
Like the electri BFQSc guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an amplifier 
and speaker for live performances.
