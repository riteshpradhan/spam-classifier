me the wrong way, well that and the wall of t-shirts in the front inviting
you to pay 22 dollars to proclaim your undying love for a mediocre
construct of a restaurant.... I'm upping my stars for Snooze after
stopping in here earlier this week for their pancake fundraiser for Parade
of Lights. The lovely Cherie C. and I both decided to get pancake flights,
so we could experience as much of the pancake deliciousness as possible. I
got 2 savory options, since the sweetness of pancakes can sometimes be too
much for me (and that's coming from a sugar addict!) The Christmas Ham
cake was my favorite, with little cubed chunks of ham and cinnamon butter
on top, followed by the Latke, with a drizzle of sour cream and green
onions on top of a potato pancake. My third cake of the flight was their
Christmas sugar cookie, decorated with sprinkles and frosting. I sampled a
few bites of Cherie's fruitcake and hot toddy pancakes, and thought both
were flavorful and creative. This trendy breakfast spot still continues to
get packed at all hours of the day - I arrived at 10 a.m. and by 11 it
seemed like the joint was full. Thumbs up to the super friendly and prompt
waitstaff, and the fact that they compost. They've got a great product
here in the coffee and the restaurant experience. Not to mention that they
strive to be sustainable and suss out the freshest ingredients. This may
not be French Laundry but there is something about this place that just
FEELS right. All the pieces come together. Snooze has vaulted ceilings,
gallons of sunshine, and a retro vibe. During our brief wait we sipped
Snooze's freakingamazing coffee while watching the artists and soaking up
the Denver sun. They know that people will wait for their food, so they
offer up all-you-can-drink coffee with heavy cream and a variety of
sweeteners. How neat is that? Outside, two cool graffiti artists were
tagging a mural of the Colorado mountains. We sipped Snooze's java and
discussed the ads for their "great hoodie sale." Plant fronds swayed
gently underneath the silent flickering of Food Channel favorites. We sat
at the bar, where our server and captain de barista, Per McKelvy, jazzed
up our breakfast with camaraderie and kindness. All of the Snooze staff
were personable and funny. Although, to be fair, I'm biased since they did
ply us with delicious foodstuffs. (Plus they liked Yelp. when I told them
that I had chosen them specifically because of Yelp, they were
complimentary and asked me for Seattle recommendations.) Out of the strong
menu content, we chose eggs and pancakes. Eggs were huevos rancheros with
fresh, local eggs, gleaming white on a bed of organic black beans, chopped
tomatoes, and a soft tortilla. Fresh, fresh, fresh. The pancake flight
combined innovative ideas with quality ingredients. The pineapple upside
down pancakes were studded with fresh
