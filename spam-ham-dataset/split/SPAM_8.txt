Great italian food in the US, 8788363 and especially in LA, makes my
little heart sing! I am, bf2764b8af63ab902491517b63c1b8d1 what you would
call, COMPLETELY OBSESSED with everything Italian - the pizzas, the
pastas, the tomatoes, the men. It's all swirled 8788363 into my favorite
memories of those Roman Nights and blazing summers. And if the food
8788363 at a stateside restaurant is good enough to transport me there, I
consider this a heavy blessing.bf2764b8af63ab902491517b63c1b8d1
