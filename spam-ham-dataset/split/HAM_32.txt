Hi all,


If you are not involved with any systems that use 
barracuda1.uah.edu/barracuda2.uah.edu/email.uah.edu for outbound email 
relay, you can ignore this message.


We have setup a service named smtp.uah.edu to provide non-authenticated, 
non-tls/ssl, "soft" smtp relay.  This is to take the place of the barracuda 
email appliances as well as any of you still using the old email server, 
email.uah.edu, as outbound relay.


This is not intended for use in desktop clients, sending via gmail is the 
preferred solution for that use case.


This service is for servers, scanners, printers, etc., that cannot make use 
of Google's smtp servers.  Often due to the limitations of the client in 
their support of authenticated, tls/ssl, smtp relay that Google requires.


Both smtp.uah.edu and the barracuda[1-2].uah.edu are available at this time. 
At some future date the barracuda's will be retired.  We may change the 
barracuda DNS entries to point to the smtp.uah.edu host as well, but that is 
not planned as yet.


Please use smtp.uah.edu port 25, no auth, going forward instead of the 
barracuda[1-2] or email.uah.edu servers.  And please change existing systems 
when convenient.


If you have trouble connecting, please contact me and also send me the 
client ip of the server so I can ensure it is allowed to connect.  The ip's 
currently allowed in the barracuda's should alredy be allowed in the smtp 
service, but I could have missed one or had a type-o.


This is not urgent at this time, I mainly want to use the new service going 
forward starting now.  New xerox printer setups and such.  It may become 
more urgent at a later date.


The new service is rate controlled BTW.


Thanks,
William
