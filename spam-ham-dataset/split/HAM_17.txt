Did you get this??

 

My oh my, how time flies!  I'm sure you recall, recipients of this email
were issued a stock option for stock in Willbrook Solutions Inc. in
December 2009 from the ISOP plan that existed at that time.  In the near
future, you will be vested 100% in that stock option.  Once vested, you
have five years to purchase the stock at the strike price of $3.42.  Once
you purchase the stock, you will share in the profits and losses of
Willbrook Solutions.  As an owner of stock, you will be issued a K-1 every
year for taxes that you will be responsible for paying.  At the discretion
of the Willbrook Solutions CEO, money can be distributed from the company
and will be divide between all owners at any time.  The amount you receive
will depend on the % ownership you have of outstanding shares of Willbrook
Solutions stock.  Remember, once you own the stock, it can not be sold or
transferred. If you voluntarily terminate your employment with Willbrook
Solutions, the company has the option to repurchase your stock, but that
repurchase is not guaranteed.  The repurchase price may be more or less
than what you paid for the stock, depending on current valuation and
future business projections.

 

An appraisal of the value of the Company is done annually for the ESOP.
Last year the appraisal placed the value of company stock at $3.38 per
share.  Since that time, stock has been repurchased and the estimated 2013
value of the company divided by outstanding shares is $3.68/share.
Should you choose to purchase stock at any time, we process the
transaction on the first day of any quarter during the year.  Your request
to purchase should be made to Ms. Kim Leach at least 2 weeks prior to the
start of the next quarter.   For example, Jan 1, 2015 would be the
earliest date you can purchase stock using your newly vested stock option.
If you plan to purchase for that transaction date, please notify Kim no
later than December 15, 2014.  If you have any questions please let me
know.
