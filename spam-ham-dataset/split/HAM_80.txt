There are also those users who learn to use computers in a very
specific way and don't like very much to change in their routines. For
IT professionals, it can seem kind of silly. However, it is definitely
possible for me to deal with a physicist who understand mathematics in
ways that I cannot even begin to grasp and, at the same time, wants to
check his email in the way that he has always checked it. Obviously, we
can only go so far to accommodate people, but I try to make the users
comfortable as much as I can do so reasonably.

Sometimes that means Outlook on Mac :)

you can't get them together again, there must be a reason. By all means,
do not use a hammer."
