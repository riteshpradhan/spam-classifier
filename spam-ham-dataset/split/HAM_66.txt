I called about 30 minutes and got voice mail. Left a message. I will try
calling back after lunch.

Also, Gordon said the SAP Security person was out yesterday and tomorrow
and I was going to have him escort me to them on Monday or Tuesday. If I
need to coordinate that through M'Rika insead though, I can do that.

Josh - See below contact POC who will help you thru the Out Processing
Process.  She can get most of the information from you via phone, but you
will need to go to VBII to get your SAP Outbrief completed, and then turn
in
your badge.  Please call her ASAP.

Thanks,

Dennis,

M'Rika Armstrong is trying to process him out and Tavaris in so she knows
exactly what is needed. Her email is m
<mailto:m%27rika.armstrong.ctr@mda.mil> 'rika.armstrong.ctr@mda.mil her
phone
is 256-450-2739 she is expecting a call from him. Sounds like she can get
the signatures if he has taken care of everything, but she needs to talk
to
him.

Josh
Please call her and see what she needs from you I will be glad to get the
forms to her for signature if you have done whatever was needed to
actually
get the signature.
