Placed portable versions of GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, and Blender on the K 
drive. Tested launching each from the "somebody" account and everything 
works. Placed shortcuts in the net apps start menu folder. Inkscape still 
needs some tweaks so it doesn't try to save user settings to the K drive.

Also, got AD authentication to work in Linux. Not as easy as we thought.
