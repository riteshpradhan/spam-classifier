We have traveled with the Army and I worked the requirements, basically we
had (2) sets of requirements - the POC from the unit we supported in Korea
sent us a list of documents needed at which point we began the process and
sent via AMRDEC safe site and he submitted to the Korean government, there
was a 2nd set of requirements in which the Prime sent forth such as
information for SPOT for the LOA's to be issued.I do know for a fact that
the LOA's will have to be issued by the Prime, in this case MERC, however,
with all of this being said I don't believe we can actually start any of
this until we have a set date.my main question to you was what do you
require as the Prime for the guys to travel - typically that includes DBA
insurance information, etc.

 

I am attaching a link for you that might help if this question arises with
other contracts, it is what the guys on the Army contract use to get basic
requirements for International Travel, also understanding that certain
units have requirements above the ones listed on this website. I assume
the requirements are the same regardless of branch of service but again,
that was a question I was hoping you guys could answer, LOL.

 

https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm

 

Together we should be able to muddle through this hopefully with as little
hassle to the traveler as possible.

Sandra,

 

I'm sorry to take so long to get back to you, but I was waiting to hear
back from our contracting office and they did not know what needed to be
done. I then contacted MSgt Hardy and he indicated that "Willbrook is very
familiar with this process as they travel to South Korea quite often
supporting the Army." Is it possible to speak with someone there to find
out what is needed as far as documents for getting into S. Korea? You will
still need to get PCO approval for the travel as usual, so you will need
to send a travel request.

 

Kathy

Deanna/Kathy

I just wanted to follow up on this email - looks like the travel will
possibly take place in January, have you been able to find out any
requirements and also what contractual requirements and paperwork will you
need from us, I would assume as the Prime your folks would be the ones to
request the LOA, etc. Please let me know, thanks for the help.

We are anticipating travel on the IVHMS task that will include travel to
Korea, do either of you happen to know if there are any specific
requirements related to the contract required? We do not have a firm date
as of yet but anticipate it will be December or January, any advice you
have would be greatly appreciated, we just want to make sure we have all
bases covered if the travel requirement does come thru.

 

Thanks so much.
