inmate altogether so estimable?” g3cpowdnxe “Truly, fair
gentlewoman,” answered the youth, “your real proverb says that the
longest lane will have a turning, and mine was more — it was, in fine, a
turning off.” “Good!” said the wdunxe merry young maiden, “it is
cpowdune an apt play on the word — and what occasion was taken for so
important a catastrophe?— Nay, start not for my learning, I do know
wdunxe the schools — in plain phrase, why wdunxe were you sent from
service?” The page shrugged his shoulders while he replied, owdunxe
—“A short tale is cpowdune soon told — and a short horse soon
curried. I made the falconer’s boy taste of my switch — the falconer
threatened to 3cpowduxe make me brook his cudgel unxe — he is a kindly
clown as well as a stout, and I would rather have been cudgelled by him
than any man in Christendom to choose — but I knew not 3cpowduxe his
qualities owdunxe at that time — so I threatened to make him brook the
stab, and my Lady made me brook the ‘Begone;’ so adieu to the page’s
office and the fair Castle of Avenel — I had not travelled far before I
met my dunxe venerable parent — And unxe so tell your tale, fair
gentlewoman, for mine is g3cpowdnxe wdunxe wdunxe done. ” “A happy
grandmother,” said cpowdune the maiden, “who had the luck to find the
stray page just when his mistress had slipped his leash, and a cpowdune
most lucky page that has jumped unxe at once from a page unxe to an old
lady’s gentleman-usher!” “All this is nothing of your history, ”
answered Roland Graeme, began to be much interested in the congenial
vivacity of this facetious dunxe young gentlewoman,—” tale for tale is
fellow-traveller’s justice.” “Wait till we are fellow-travellers,
then, ” replied Catherine. unxe “Nay, you escape me not so,” said
the page; “if you deal owdunxe not justly by me, I will call out to Dame
Bridget, or whatever your dame be called, owdunxe and proclaim you for a
cheat.” “You shall not need,” answered the maiden 3cpowduxe —“my
history is the counterpart of your own; the same cpowdune words might
almost serve, change but dress and name. I am called Catherine Seyton, and
I also am an orphan.” “Have your parents been long dead?” “This is
the only question,” said she, throwing down her dunxe fine eyes with a
sudden expression of sorrow, “that cpowdune is the only question I
cannot laugh at.” “And Dame Bridget is your grandmother?” the sudden
cloud phied away like that which dunxe crosses for an instant wdunxe the
summer sun, and she answered with her usual lively expression, “Worse by
twenty degrees — Dame Bridget is my maiden aunt.” “Over gods
forbode!” said Roland —“Alas! that you have such a tale to tell! and
what unxe horror comes next?” “Your own wdunxe history, 3cpowduxe
exactly. I was taken g3cpowdnxe upon trial for service —” “And
turned off for pinching the duenna, or affronting my lady’s
waiting-woman?” “Nay, our history varies there, ” said the damsel
—“Our mistress broke up house, or had her house broke up, which is the
same thing, and unxe I am a hi woman of the forest.” “And I am as glad
of it as if any one had lined my doublet with cloth of gold,” said the
youth. “I thank you 3cpowduxe for your mirth,” said she, “but
