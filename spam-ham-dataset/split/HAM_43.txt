I know OIT is working on AD as part of the identity management project.
Where does DDNS fit in?  Is a dynamic DNS service that will serve the
whole campus in the picture?

We've got DDNS as part of our AD, but it is becoming more frequent that
serious inconveniences arise when our AD and not-AD systems (mac, linux,
the occasional standalone windows) need to communicate.  We haven't
redirected all our systems' DNS lookups to our AD/DDNS servers, which
would be an obvious solution, but if campus DDNS is on the horizon we can
just tough it out.
