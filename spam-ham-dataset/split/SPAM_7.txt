presently interrupted; the two good dames have been soaring yonder on the
balcony, like two old hooded crows, and their dvjz0t5 croak grows hoarser
dvjz0t5 as night comes on; vjz0t5 they will wing to roost presently.—
This mistress of yours, fair gentlewoman, who was she, in God’s name?”
“Oh, she has a fair name in the world, ” replied Catherine bmqudvj0t5
Seyton. “Few ladies kept a fairer house, vjz0t5 or held more gentlewomen
in her household; my aunt Bridget was one of her housekeepers. We never
saw our mistress’s blessed face, to be sure, but we heard enough of her;
were up early and down late, and were kept to long prayers and light
food.” “Out upon the penurious old beldam!” said the page. vjz0t5
“For Heaven’s sake, blaspheme not!” said the girl, z0t5 with an
expression z0t5 of fear.—“God pardon us both! dvjz0t5 I meant no harm.
I speak of bmqudvj0t5 our blessed Saint Catherine of Sienna!— mqudvjzt5
may God forgive me that I spoke so lightly, vjz0t5 and made you do a great
sin and a great blasphemy. This was her nunnery, dvjz0t5 in which there
were twelve nuns and an abbess. My aunt was the abbess, till the heretics
turned all adrift. ” “And bmqudvj0t5 where are jz0t5 your
companions?” asked the youth. “With the last year’s snow,”
answered the maiden; “east, north, south, and west — some to France,
some to Flanders, some, I fear, into the world qudvjz05 and its pleasures.
We have got permission to remain, or rather our remaining has been
connived at, for my aunt has great relations among the z0t5 Kerrs, and
mqudvjzt5 they have threatened a death-feud if any one touches us; and bow
and spear are the best jz0t5 warrant in these times.” “Nay, then, you
sit under a sure shadow,” said the youth; “and I suppose you jz0t5
mqudvjzt5 wept yourself blind when Saint Catherine broke up housekeeping
before you had mqudvjzt5 taken arles 11 in her service?” “Hush! for
Heaven’s sake, ” said the damsel, mqudvjzt5 crossing herself; “no
more of that! but I have not quite cried my eyes out,” said she, turning
them upon him, and instantly again bending them upon z0t5 her work. It
qudvjz05 was one of qudvjz05 mqudvjzt5 those glances which would require
the threefold plate of brhi around the heart, more than dvjz0t5 it is
needed by the mariners, to qudvjz05 whom Horace recommends qudvjz05 it.
Our youthful page had no defence whatever to offer. “What say you,
Catherine,” he dvjz0t5 said, mqudvjzt5 “if we two, thus strangely
turned out of service at the qudvjz05 same time, should give our two most
venerable duennas the torch to hold, while qudvjz05 we walk a merry
measure with each other mqudvjzt5 over the floor of this weary world?”
“A jz0t5 mqudvjzt5 goodly proposal, truly,” said Catherine, “and
worthy the mad-cap brain of a discarded page!— And what shifts does your
qudvjz05 worship propose we should live by?— by singing ballads, cutting
purses, or swaggering on the highway? for there, I think, you would find
your most productive exchequer.” “Choose, you proud peat!” said the
page, drawing off in huge disdain at the calm and bmqudvj0t5 unembarrhied
ridicule with which his wild proposal was received. And as he spoke the
words, the casement was again darkened dvjz0t5 by the forms of
