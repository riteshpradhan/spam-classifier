breakfast food. Hard to tear myself away from the pineapple upside down
pancakes or the corned beef hash. But yesterday I ventured where I'd never
gone before and tried the Sandwich I Am. It was a seriously good breakfast
sausage sandwich layered on a deeelicious Udi's pretzl bun. What put it
over the top was the side cup of smoked cheddar hollandaise. Scarily good,
and big enough so I could have split it with my baby, were she the person
across from me, instead of my fancy-pants lawyer friend; but at least he
didn't charge me by the hour for chowin' down with him, or that would have
made Snooze the most expensive restaurant in the city. Anytime I come back
to Denver, I will be paying these guys a visit. First off, the staff, the
food, the prices and the atmosphere are perfect. I walked close to a mile
at 6 in the morning in December to get some breakfast and I would do it
again. The staff was very helpful in helping me choose what to eat, where
to go in Denver and simply being there to talk to me as I was alone. Since
I wanted something savory, I ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo
and tomettio green chili sauce. However, since their best seller is the
pineapple upside down pancake they gave me a sample of it. How nice
Breakfast burrito - Besides the fact that it could have fed a small
family, it was delicious, perfectly balanced amounts of meat, eggs, beans,
potatoes and green chili sauce. I could go for one right now. Pineapple
upside down pancake - I have never in my life, had a moist, airy pancake
like this. I am not a big fan of the sweet breakfast or pineapples, but
let me tell you... I finished it even after I could not finish my burrito.
I can see why its so popular. Do yourself a favor, go check them out...
ask them what you should get, have a great conversation with the staff and
go to sleep thereafter from over stuffing yourself Snooze is honestly the
best breakfast place I've been too! Ever! I ordered the Breakfast pot pie,
which is basically a scrumptious layered flaky croissant like roll topped
with tasty gravy with chunks of sausage and an egg cooked how ever one
would like it :) It also came with a delicious hash brown cylinder on the
side. But I didn't stop there! I also sampled the pancake of the day,
which just so happened to be a chocolate chip filled, vanilla and
blueberry sauce covered pancake. It was what pancakes would be like in
heaven I'm sure. It covered the whole plate, almost an inch thick, but
light and fluffy. I am still dreaming about it... anyway, back to reality!
We received excellent customer service. They have a great menu, with all
the options one would ever want to breakfast. Some lighter options as
well. Looking around at what others had ordered I can honestly say that
everything looked amazing! I will be going back in the near future and
suggesting Snooze to my family and friends.
