Cody, the lab machines have Java JRE 7u5.  Which version should they be
running to be safe?

I have 7u6 on my office PC.

Afternoon Gentlemen,

Just a little heads up: 

http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/critical-flaw-under-active-attack-
pr
ompts-calls-to-disable-java/

Can someone pull the current version number for JVE we have around the
domain, please?

I've been keeping an eye on Zenith's logs remotely when I'm off-shift due
to
being the WINSEC contact in the office (Tim should be aware this does
affect
GNU\Linux as well), which has been clear thus far other than a dormant
piece
of old malware on REMUS being caught (that slipped in while it was under
McAfee ePO). However, that may very well change as this code starts to
circulate before Oracle releases a CUP. As soon as it's available @
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html) , I
would request that we do a quick manual deployment.


Mr. Jones, if you'd like to access the aforementioned logs without having
to
RDP in and start the management console, please let myself or Mr. Toone
know
for the link and menu path.
