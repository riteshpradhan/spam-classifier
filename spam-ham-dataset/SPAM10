Tesla Engine Plans Released  to Public (Patent Loophole)
=========================================
Patent No. 7865052
Publication Date:  09.29.15

rcoleman@cs.uah.edu, 

More than 180 years ago... Robert Stirling, a Scottish clergyman invented something that shook the coal and energy industry to the ground.

Stirling found a way to make an engine work literally on thin air using Tesla Power.

Unfortunately, his device became the first-ever suppressed 'free energy' generator. Only a few people had ever seen it.

Now, for the first time, the 'misplaced' blueprints of the Stirling Engine have been discovered and translated into 'plain English' so anyone can use them.

Go here to see how Elon Musk incorporated this technology to make the remarkable Tesla Battery Packs--  http://gohere.freeengineahead.date/trynow


Thanks for reading,
Editor, Entrepreneur Mag.

Hi,

Did you see this on the news last night?  They said it's better to DIE from a stroke than go thru the HORRID things that happen after.

But they also said there is something you can do to prevent a stroke from ever happening. I'm getting some today! You should too.

Go to this website to see the five HORRID things that happen if you have a stroke and how to prevent one, http://findoutmore.freedomcardiac.racing/learnhow

Bye,

Important Medical Information for rcoleman@cs.uah.edu,

A Christian Doctor, Dr. Mark Strengler, has tapped into an ancient medicine for treating, and even curing, desperate terminal patients.

This ancient medicine has the ability to cure Cancer patients and people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis.

It has been proven to prevent strokes and reverse type-1 and type-2 diabetes as well.

Go here now to find out how you can save your or your loved one's lives from previously incurable diseases-- http://learnmore.achievementhealth.review/medical


**********************************************
"I became a patient of Dr. Stengler. He put me on a strategic nutritional protocol to get rid of my plaque. After one year, I had a repeat ultrasound of my carotid arteries. They were 100% clear. The attending doctor stated 'This is unusual. I don???t ever see that type of reversal. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised since Dr. Stengler's natural treatment also reversed my wife's newly diagnosed type II diabetes.

Thank you, Dr. Stengler. I can now enjoy my recent retirement in great health!"

Best chance for pay increase in the office...


It's now shown that an MBA is the fastest path to pay-increase and
workplace promotions. An MBA can be done in 10-12 months 100% online,
unlike traditional MBA's that used to take two years. They can even be
completed on the weekend. MBA FAQ and ad-below.

http://www.rhyd1.com/accelerated-MBA.html


Points of interest:
> Can be done on the weekend <
> Employer may pay for your program <
> Earnings increase of 75% (average) <



You will not have to worry about going to class because it 100% online.
you can still enjoy your social life and your family time.
