Did you get this??

 

My oh my, how time flies!  I'm sure you recall, recipients of this email
were issued a stock option for stock in Willbrook Solutions Inc. in
December 2009 from the ISOP plan that existed at that time.  In the near
future, you will be vested 100% in that stock option.  Once vested, you
have five years to purchase the stock at the strike price of $3.42.  Once
you purchase the stock, you will share in the profits and losses of
Willbrook Solutions.  As an owner of stock, you will be issued a K-1 every
year for taxes that you will be responsible for paying.  At the discretion
of the Willbrook Solutions CEO, money can be distributed from the company
and will be divide between all owners at any time.  The amount you receive
will depend on the % ownership you have of outstanding shares of Willbrook
Solutions stock.  Remember, once you own the stock, it can not be sold or
transferred. If you voluntarily terminate your employment with Willbrook
Solutions, the company has the option to repurchase your stock, but that
repurchase is not guaranteed.  The repurchase price may be more or less
than what you paid for the stock, depending on current valuation and
future business projections.

 

An appraisal of the value of the Company is done annually for the ESOP.
Last year the appraisal placed the value of company stock at $3.38 per
share.  Since that time, stock has been repurchased and the estimated 2013
value of the company divided by outstanding shares is $3.68/share.
Should you choose to purchase stock at any time, we process the
transaction on the first day of any quarter during the year.  Your request
to purchase should be made to Ms. Kim Leach at least 2 weeks prior to the
start of the next quarter.   For example, Jan 1, 2015 would be the
earliest date you can purchase stock using your newly vested stock option.
If you plan to purchase for that transaction date, please notify Kim no
later than December 15, 2014.  If you have any questions please let me
know.

Updated the DNS entries for the teamX records. I removed the extra records 
(team8, team9, etc) from DNS. The new records point to the server IP for 
that team.

Started working on setting up the new HP machines for N327.
BIOS Changes:

*	Security Tab

*	Setup Password

*	Set BIOS password

*	Secure Boot Configuration

*	Enable Legacy Boot
*	Disable Secure Boot
*	Disable Fast Boot

*	System Security

*	Enable Visualization Technology (VTx/VTd)

Installed Windows 7 Enterpise 64-bit with GPT for UEFI computers. Currently 
static'd the IP to 146.229.236.249, which I was last using for the GameLab 
Image machine.
Installed drivers and ran windows updates. I also installed Visual Studio 
2010 & 2012 Ultimate.

No other major announcements.

-Match time 1030am 
-We'll play 9v9 so we'll run the typical formation but with an extra
midfielder.

Good evening MOD 501 students,

As I mentioned on the first day of class, I will not be able to lecture on
Thursday Sep 11 due to a business trip.  Class that day is cancelled.

Please use the time to study the content of Chapters 1 and 6.

 

There will be a normal lecture tomorrow, Tuesday Sep 9.

 

Regards, Mikel Petty
